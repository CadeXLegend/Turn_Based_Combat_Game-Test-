# Turn Based Combat Game [Test]

My pet project.  This game is heavily inspired by the many RPGs I have played since childhood.

Some of these include but are not limited to:
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Battle Chasers: Night Wars
* Adventure Quest & Adventure Quest: Worlds
* Dragon Fable
* Invisible Inc
* Final Fantasy
